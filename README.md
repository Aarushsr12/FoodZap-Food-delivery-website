# FoodZap


## Inspiration

Main motive was to achieve the passwordless authentication and seamless transaction over the website. We have integrated the **SAWO labs API** for fast-login and to quickly order our food and pay through **Razorpay API** gateway having numerous Payment options.
 
## What it does
It's a food delievery website, no more remembering the passwords, just login-in in one tap and order your at your doorstep. Customers are offered secured transactions and several meal plans.

## How we built it
We had built the website using Front-end tools like HTML,CSS, Javascript and integrated the Sawo API for login and Razorpay API for Payment Gateway. For Backend to fetch the Payment details from the user we designed the server using ```Node.js``` which will be fetching the details and process out the unique order id to the user and razorpay payment dashboard.

## Challenges we ran into
1. Working on server.js to fetch the details on a port and secure the user data.
2. Payment input from the user to be fetched in amount variable intially was not working

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of what we have learned while making this project using APIs first time was quite a amazing challenge. Making a website flow and working on payement system was a great learning for us.
## What we learned
1. Using Sawo API and Razorpay API in Web Developement.
2. Working on Backend (```Node.js```) and generating the unique order details.

##  What's next for FoodZap
Well, Next time we will be integrating the Twilio API for instant notifications , messaging and will make site more responsive
